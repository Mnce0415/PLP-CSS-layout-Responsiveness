I need some help here. 

On VSCode when I open with live server having the lines:
(meta charset="UTF-8")
(meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0")

My code was completely irresponsive and gave big content.


After ignoring the lines above and this one: 
(link rel="stylesheet" href="styling.css")

It worked very well and responsiveness was there

It seems that it only allowed me to do internal CSS, please go through the repo and get back to me with a solution to why this is.

thanks
